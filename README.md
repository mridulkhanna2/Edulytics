# Edulytics

A Python-based academic insight assistant that analyzes student performance 
to find patterns between study habits, sleep, stress, and grades.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.
2. Open a terminal in this folder and run:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Then run:

Note:
- Graphs would not open in Ed, as they open in a seperate window, would suggest to use an IDE like Visual Studio or similar. You can also refer the insights from Option 8 - summary report
